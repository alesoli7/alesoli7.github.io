    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My name is Alessia, I am Italian and I am currently living in London. I moved to the UK almost 8 years ago, and I have started working in the Hospitality sector, where I have worked for 6 years before finally leaving it. I then understood I wanted to start studying again, so in 2017 I went back to college and I have decided to move forward to higher education. I have always been interested in journalism due to the fact that I love writing. Through the years I developed an interest in photojournalism as well, but even more in investigative journalism. Even though this is my second year at university, I am still not sure what path I should follow when it comes to a future career. Outside university I work as teaching assistant, I practice yoga and I am a passionate reader.
