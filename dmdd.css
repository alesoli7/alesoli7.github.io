<p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> Hello everyone! I'm Alessia, and I am in my second year doing Journalism and Media. Outside university I work as teaching assistant in primary schools. I would like to become an investigative journalist one day, hopefully! I am addicted to yoga and chocolate, and I love books and photography, even though I am not that talented, I do it for fun.
